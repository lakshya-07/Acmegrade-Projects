# Acmegrade Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my Acmegrade projects repository! Here, you'll find two exciting projects I completed as part of the Machine Learning course: Face Detection and Movie Recommendation.

## Face Detection Project ðŸ‘¤

In this project, I implemented a face detection system using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques. The system is capable of detecting faces in images and videos with high accuracy. Leveraging libraries like OpenCV and TensorFlow, I explored various face detection algorithms and fine-tuned them for optimal performance. This project is perfect for understanding the fundamentals of computer vision and its real-world applications.

### Key Features:
- Detection of faces in images 
- Integration of deep learning models for improved accuracy

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow


## Movie Recommendation Project ðŸŽ¬

The movie recommendation project is an exciting dive into the world of recommendation systems. Using collaborative filtering techniques and machine learning algorithms, I built a recommendation engine capable of suggesting movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. By analyzing large datasets of user ratings/votings and movie metadata, the system provides personalized recommendations, enhancing user experience and engagement on streaming platforms.

### Key Features:
- Collaborative filtering for user-based and item-based recommendations
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for predicting user preferences

### Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
